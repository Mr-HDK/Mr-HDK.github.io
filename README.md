# Mr‑HDK.github.io

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is
designed to showcase my expertise across **cybersecurity**, **AI**,
**DevSecOps** and **software development**. The site is
entirely static and is hosted using GitHub&nbsp;Pages.

## ✨ Features

* **Modern responsive design** &mdash; built with HTML, CSS and
  vanilla JavaScript for fast loading and ease of maintenance. The
  layout adapts elegantly across desktop, tablet and mobile screens.
* **Dark/Light theme toggle** &mdash; click the moon icon in the
  top‑right corner to switch between themes. Your preference is
  remembered using `localStorage`.
* **Animated sections and skill bars** &mdash; content fades in
  smoothly as you scroll, and skill bars animate to reflect
  proficiency levels.
* **Projects showcase** &mdash; highlights some of my key
  open‑source projects with descriptions and links to the
  repositories.
* **Interactive tools** &mdash; includes a Base64 converter and a
  SHA‑256 hash generator built with JavaScript. These tools
  demonstrate practical utilities useful in security and
  development workflows.
* **Blog and contact information** &mdash; placeholders for future
  articles and a section listing ways to get in touch. A link to my
  résumé is also provided.
